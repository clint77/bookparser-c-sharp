## BOOK PARSING USING C#

+ This is an application that outputs the individual words that appear in a sample text file, and how many times that word appears in the text file. The second part is to also output whether the number of times each word appears is a prime number or not. The application ignores punctuation, numbers and capitalisation. Tried using TDD. 
+ I will come up with another version using a different approach

## Technology
+ C#
+ NUnit for testing
+ Xamarin Studio for Mac
